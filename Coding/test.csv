Double Bag,252,Altbier,8,Long Trail Brewing Co.,"Notes:This malty, full-bodied double alt is also known as “Stickebier” – German slang for “secret brew”. Long Trail Double Bag was originally offered only in our brewery taproom as a special treat to our visitors. With an alcohol content of 7.2%, please indulge in moderation. The Long Trail Brewing Company is proud to have Double Bag named Malt Advocate’s “Beer of the Year” in 2001. Malt Advocate is a national magazine devoted to “expanding the boundaries of fine drinks”. Their panel of judges likes to keep things simple, and therefore of thousands of eligible competitors they award only two categories: “Imported” and “Domestic”. It is a great honor to receive this recognition.33 IBU	",7.2,3.9,25,50,12,57,18,33,55,16,0,24,35,12,84

Very Very Far,1749,Blonde Ale - Belgian,42,Off Color Brewing,"Notes:Belgian Style Ale brewed with White Wine Yeast. Inspired by the classic Belgian style ales which drew us into brewing in the first place. We add a twist on the spirit of Belgian mixed fermentation by utilizing a non-traditional wine yeast, Torulaspora delbrueckii. Torulaspora enhances fruitiness while a classic Belgian ale yeast imparts a Belgian spice character. Golden multifaceted Belgian style ale with subtle fruity notes of apricot, lychee, currant, and honey layered with noble hop spice and peppercorn phenol notes.

Ayinger Celebrator,1,Bock - Doppelbock,2,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,"Notes:A beer that has a dominant malty taste. This beer’s origins in a monk’s recipe are reflected in its heartiness. The Pope of Beers, Conrad Seidl, describes it as: “Almost black with a very slight red tone, a sensational, festive foam and truly extraordinary fragrance that at first summons up visions of greaves lard. The first taste is of mild fullness with an accompanying coffee tone, which becomes more dominant with the aftertaste. There is very little of the sweetness that is frequently to be tasted with doppelbock beer.” The Ayinger Celebrator has been ranked among the best beers of the world by the Chicago Testing Institute several times and has won numerous medals.
